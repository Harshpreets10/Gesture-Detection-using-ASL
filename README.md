## **American Sign Language**

People with special needs have always struggled to communicate and express themselves. The general public's failure to acquire sign language is causing a communication vacuum, and as a result, the specially-abled have limited access to school and nearly no opportunities for gainful employment.

We accessed this problem statement and tried our best to fill in the GAP and make life easier for them.

### **Requirements to run your Python code** 
-**Step 1 :** Pull the code file into any code editor supporting .ipynb files.
-**Step 2 :** Download the dataset1 , dataset2 and dataset3 from Kaggle.
-**Step 3 :** Install all the necessary imports mentioned in the .ipynb code files using pip(preferred installer program).

Note: If you are using google colab you can easily perform the above mentioned steps.

### **Instruction on how to train/validate your model**
All the functions are already defined and made generic in the code. Also, the comments are mentioned on how to train/validate the model. You can just follow the steps mentioned in the code to easily execute the code file.

Instructions on how to run the pre-trained model on the provided sample test dataset
-**Step 1 :** We have already provided the four pre-trained model weight files for Dataset1 in the repository.
-**Step 2 :** Run the code with the pre-trained weights on the sample test dataset by importing them with the help of "torch.load()" function and then run the "test function" to see the results. Different weight files can also be provided by communicating with any team member. 


All the source code files has already been uploaded to Github repository.

### **Description on how to obtain the Dataset from an available download link**
You can easily download the three datasets from Kaggle, here are the available links-
-[Dataset1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet)
-[Dataset2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/asl-dataset)
-[Dataset3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayuraj/american-sign-language-dataset)
